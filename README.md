# Tipytip

You have seen so many app that calculates tips for you. This one 
adds one more step and calculates what percentage your tip was. 

Example: Let's say you usually pay 15% tip and today's cost was $60. That means 
you will pay $9 in tips. But you decided that you do not have much time to calculate 
and wanted to just give them $10. Later on that night, you wonder how much percentage 
did you tip. Now you can just calculate that.

### `npm start`
