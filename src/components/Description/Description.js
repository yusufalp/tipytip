    out of your wallet or pocket? What if you are in a hurry?</p>
      <p>Then you go home, relax, think about your day and suddenly remember
      your tip. How much did you tip? Yes, but was that enough? Were you fair
      to the service you received? Really, how much percent that $20 you just tipped
    without thinking is?</p>
      <p>Wonder no more!</p>
